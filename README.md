## Idea
I love MOBA games and played a ton of games in the past (mainly Dota 1 and League of Legends). I no longer play, but still watch competitive LoL on weekends.
I feel like there are a lot of topics learned in class can be put into making a MOBA bot due to the highly strategic nature of the genre. Also, I wanted to learn to play Dota 2 for a long time, might as well use this opportunity.

Apparently it's not feasible to make a smart enough bot that can compete against pro, but I'd like to accomplish the followingtasks:

* Farming
* Animation cancelling
* Landing/dodging projectiles
* Predicting enemy pathing
* Creep blocking
* Adaptive item shopping
* More..

The main language will be Lua since the API supports it.
